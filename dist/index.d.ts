/**
 * An instance can subscribe to any of the following events by doing `instance.on([eventName], callback)`,
 * events can be triggered by doing `instance.emit([eventName][, params])`
 *
 * - `mouseover` fired whenever the mouse is over the canvas
 * - `mousemove` fired whenever the mouse is moved inside the canvas, callback params: a single object `{x: number, y: number}` (in canvas space
 coordinates)
 * - `mouseout` fired whenever the mouse is moved outside the canvas
 * - `before:draw` fired before drawing all the graphs
 * - `after:draw` fired after drawing all the graphs
 * - `zoom:scaleUpdate` fired whenever the scale of another graph is updated, callback params `xScale`, `yScale`
 (x-scale and y-scale of another graph whose scales were updated)
 * - `tip:update` fired whenever the tip position is updated, callback params `{x, y, index}` (in canvas
 space coordinates, `index` is the index of the graph where the tip is on top of)
 * - `eval` fired whenever the sampler evaluates a function, callback params `data` (an array of segment/points),
 `index` (the index of datum in the `data` array), `isHelper` (true if the data is created for a helper e.g.
 for the derivative/secant)
 *
 * The following events are dispatched to all the linked graphs
 *
 * - `all:mouseover` same as `mouseover` but it's dispatched in each linked graph
 * - `all:mousemove` same as `mousemove` but it's dispatched in each linked graph
 * - `all:mouseout` same as `mouseout` but it's dispatched in each linked graph
 * - `all:zoom:scaleUpdate` same as `zoom:scaleUpdate` but it's dispatched in each linked graph
 * - `all:zoom` fired whenever there's scaling/translation on the graph, dispatched on all the linked graphs
